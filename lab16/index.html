		<h1>Lab 16 - JSON and APIs</h1>
		<p>by Emily Baer and Hannah Hodor</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>The challenge of this lab was to experiment with processing JSON from an API.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>One problem we ran into was because JavaScript is asynchronus. The methods that we called on the comic object did not work because they ran before the comic object had been fully created. We solved this by moving the operations with the comic object into the success function.</p>
	</div>

  <div>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>The results of this lab are this page. The first comic is the result of the lab requirements. The second comic is the result of the bonus task.</p>
