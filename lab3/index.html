</div>
<div>
	<h2>Subject</h2>
	<p>The subject of this lab was learning how to navigate file structures and how to transfer files within file structues. It was also to show that we can create links between our HTML pages and properly reference images, divs, paragraphs, and headers. </p>
</div>
<div>
	<h2>Difficulties Encountered</h2>
	<p>We encountered difficulties in scaling our image. We resolved this issue by assigning our img in html with an id, aka putting it in a container. After that, we are able to use CSS to resize the image into the size we prefer.</p>
</div>
<div>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>This lab is now linked to labs 2 through 6, including itself. Our local files are well structured. The index page contains an introduction about its creator and an image as well. The lab is also explored on this page.</p>
