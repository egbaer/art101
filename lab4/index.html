	<h1>Challenge</h1>
	<p>The goal of this lab is to think in terms of pseudocode in order to prepare for coding. In this lab, my partner and I will attempt to pseudocode one everyday task and one computer task. By the end of this lab we should have an idea of how instructions can be followed by a computer as they are by people. We will also learn how to make comments in Javascript.</p>

	<h1>Problems</h1>
	<p>Translating regular lists into potential code lexicon is tricky for someone who is not computer savy and or familiar with coding language. It is also challenging to choose the key tasks to be followed when coding instructions. There were some problems properly aligning the code from JS and the list of pseudocoded task steps. Margins were used to collect those.</p>

		<h2>How to Make a Cat Like You</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Step 1: Look up the cats full name</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Look at the cat’s collar if you have enough bravery</li>
				<li>If not, resort to Google</li>
					<ul>
						<li>If you discover the cat is #canceled whilst searching Google, immediately stop associating with them.</li>
					</ul>
			</ul>
			<li>Step 2: Forget their name immediately</li>
			<li>Step 3: Kneel to the cats eye level</li>
			<li>Step 4: Make intense eye contact with the cat for at least 10 minutes</li>
			<li>Step 5: Blink 3 times very slowly</li>
			<ul>
				<li>If the cat blinks back, congrats! The cat likes you</li>
				<li>If it doesn’t blink, proceed to Step 6</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Step 6: Find a fish, preferably fresh</li>
			<li>Step 7: Rub it on yourself the same way you would apply perfume</li>
			<li>Step 8: Repeat steps 4 and 5</li>
			<ul>
				<li>If the cat blinks back, congrats! The cat likes you</li>
				<li>If it doesn’t blink, proceed to Step 9</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Step 9: Repeat steps 4 and 5 while offering the cat a piece of the fish</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Nice plating that includes garnish makes this more likely to work</li>
				<li>If the cat blinks back, congrats! The cat likes you</li>
				<li>If the cat doesn’t blink back, the cat is a hater and does not like you</li>
			</ul>

	<p>The list above is a pseudocoded everyday task for how to get a cat to like you.</p>
	<div class = "codelist">
	<p><pre><code>
		//Store a template for a greeting message with placeholders for where the user input will be inserted.
		//Take and store user input in separate variables. The user input should include:
		    //The user’s name
		    //The name of the person receiving the message
		    //The date
		    //Any input for a postscript section
		//Replace the placeholder text in the greeting message with the corresponding user input
		//Print a test message and ask for the user to accept or deny the message
		    //If message is denied, clear the template and begin the process again
		    //If the message is approved, continue on to the next step
		//Print the message to a pdf for the user to print out
