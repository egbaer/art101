    <h1>Challenges</h1>
      <p>The challenge of this Lab was to teach the student how to use JavaScript in the console and how making arrays and objects works and the differences between them. This is our second submission because our first submission was a "fucking shit-show". (Kiyo) On that note, thank you, Wes, for saving our asses because <em>"oh my god we were panicking so bad"</em>. (Ramola)</p>

    <h1>Problems</h1>
      <p>We didn't run into too many issues this time around, most likely because we were able to learn from our mistakes and talked to our professor about what was confusing us. The problems we did face were small though, when we couldn't get the function for the age to work Kiyo suggested writing myMainRide.age() and that ended up fixing the issue!</p>

    <h1>Results</h1>
      <p>This website and the script output you see below are the results of our hard work and multiple attempts at this lab. Being able to finally understand what we are doing instead of just copying them is a <em>very</em> rewarding experience.</p>
