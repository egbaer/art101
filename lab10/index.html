      <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p>The goal of this lab was to get us to begin playing around with giving HTML elements ways to be interacted with through JS. Basically, make the user be able to change the webpage through interactions carried out through JS.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>We, once again, <span>forgor</span> to add the defer attribute to our link to our JS file. We had trouble ensuring that the anonymous function used in the eventListener had the proper parentheses and curly braces. We also had to keep checking that our names for the variables matched with each other.</p>
    </div>

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>Below is the div that will be modified with JS!</p>
      <label>
        Enter your name to be sorted: <input type="text" id="user-name">
      </label>
      <button id="my-button">Submit</button>
      <div id="output"><p>This paragraph will be destroyed when you click the button above.</p></div>
